# Open Questions

A running list of unresolved decisions. This list is expected to grow and
shrink over time — when a question is resolved, move the decision (and
rationale) into the relevant doc (`data-model-notes.md`, `vision.md`, etc.)
and either remove it here or mark it resolved with a pointer.

## Recently resolved

Kept here briefly for context; full rationale lives in the linked docs, not
here.

- **Sensitive-sighting default visibility: an organization's own call, set
  per property — not auto-detected from a sensitive-species list.**
  (2026-08-28, owner decision.) Rather than Habitat maintaining or
  inferring which species are sensitive and auto-flagging sightings of
  them, an admin sets a per-property default (e.g. "default new sightings
  on this property to private") and every sighting on that property
  starts from that default, same as today's own per-record flag still
  lets any one record be overridden either way. See
  `data-model-notes.md`. **Not yet implemented** — needs a new
  `Property`-level field, a migration, and default-application on
  sighting create in both the API and the sighting form; a follow-up
  build item, not done as part of this decision.
- **Should the public-facing view surface the sighting↔activity link?
  Yes** (2026-08-28, owner decision) — e.g. "reported by a visitor,
  treated on this date." **Not yet implemented** — the public site's
  serializers/views and `PublicPropertyPage` don't expose the link yet;
  a follow-up build item.
- **Starter species list: none — every new account's species list starts
  completely empty.** (2026-08-28, owner decision.) No change needed;
  this was already the existing behavior, just confirmed rather than
  left open.
- **Default workflow states for a brand-new account: the existing
  Planned → In Progress → Done seed is fine.** (2026-08-28, owner
  decision, confirming the assumption made when this was first built —
  see the 2026-08-07 `CLAUDE.md` task-log entry.) No change needed.
- **Licensing of public data: leave unlicensed (all rights reserved by
  default) for now.** (2026-08-28, owner decision.) Revisit once a real
  Phase 4 API or Phase 5 public-input program makes licensing terms
  actually matter to someone consuming the data.
- **Public visibility default and override.** Activity and sighting
  records are public by default, and every individual record — not just an
  account- or property-wide setting — carries its own public/private flag,
  so any one record can be marked private regardless of the default. See
  `data-model-notes.md` and `roadmap.md` Phase 2. Still open: whether the
  flag is binary or has more states, who can set/change it, and the
  sharper sensitive-species default-behavior question for sightings (see
  "Public-facing behavior" below).
- **Property also got its own public/private flag** (`Property.is_public`,
  default `true`), on top of the per-record flag above — added when the
  Phase 2 public site was actually built, once it became clear an org
  managing one public property and one private one (e.g. a land trust's
  preserve alongside a manager's own yard) needs to keep the private one
  off the public site entirely, not rely on marking every record private
  one at a time. See `data-model-notes.md`.
- **The Phase 2 public site is built**, in two shapes: a per-property page
  and a per-organization "portfolio" page (linked from the logged-in
  app's nav as "Public site", plus a link on the org admin portal), both
  unauthenticated (`backend/apps/public_site/`) and both offering a way
  back to `/login`. URLs are plain numeric IDs
  (`/public/org/<id>`, `/public/properties/<id>`) — no slug/vanity URL
  yet, see "Tech / infrastructure" below. **The map itself now visually
  distinguishes planned/in-progress work from completed work** (dashed
  orange vs. solid green, with a legend) — the specific Phase 2 roadmap
  requirement (`roadmap.md`) that was still open even after the rest of
  the public site shipped; the same styling also applies to the
  logged-in `PropertyMapPage`, not just the public one. Based on
  `ActivitySerializer`'s new `is_done` field rather than a three-way
  planned/in-progress/done split, sidestepping the still-open "are
  planned/done-equivalent states reserved" question below.
- **Sightings vs. interventions: separate tables, connected by a direct
  many-to-many link — not gated behind a task.** A sighting links straight
  to one or more activities (and vice versa); a **task** is a separate,
  optional, assignable to-do (see below) that doesn't have to be involved
  at all. See `data-model-notes.md` and `use-cases.md` (f). **The link is
  now reachable from the app, not just the schema** — a "Linked
  activities"/"Linked sightings" section on each record's edit page lets
  you create or remove the link directly (`/api/sightings/<id>/links/`
  and the `/api/activities/<id>/links/` mirror of it).
- **Task model: optional, and intentionally simple in the initial
  build.** A task is plain user-to-user assignment (any contributor can
  assign a task to any other, or to themselves) — not a required step for
  linking a sighting to an activity, and not automatically created when a
  sighting is logged. See `data-model-notes.md` and `use-cases.md` (g).
  **Now has a real API + UI** — `/api/tasks/` (org-scoped CRUD, same
  viewer/editor/admin convention as everything else) and a `/tasks` page
  (list with status filter, inline status/assignee change, create form
  optionally tied to an existing sighting or activity). Still open: exact
  status states beyond the current fixed
  open/assigned/resolved/dismissed set, and notification mechanics (see
  "Data model" below) — nothing pings the assignee today, they just have
  to check the Tasks page.
- **Status lifecycle beyond planned/done: org-defined, not a fixed global
  enum.** Each account/organization can define its own workflow states
  rather than Habitat imposing one status set on everyone. See
  `data-model-notes.md`. Still open: sensible defaults for a brand-new
  account, and whether planned/done-equivalents are reserved states every
  custom workflow must map onto (see "Data model" below).
- **Species/treatment reference data: account-defined, not an external
  taxonomy.** Each account maintains its own species list, defined by
  whoever manages that account, rather than Habitat integrating an outside
  standard (GBIF, USDA PLANTS) from the start. See `data-model-notes.md`.
- **What a "property" or "parcel" is: user-drawn, not tied to a legal
  parcel.** Habitat doesn't require or validate against cadastral/parcel
  data — a property is whatever area a user draws and names, which will
  often approximate real property lines without being sourced from them.
  See `data-model-notes.md`.
- **Account model: one Habitat instance/account = one organization or
  manager**, which may currently have one contributor or many — every
  account supports multiple users and multiple properties from creation,
  with no separate individual-vs-org account types and no migration step
  to unlock multi-user support. See `data-model-notes.md`.
- **Organization-management UI: uniform for every account, regardless of
  size.** A one-person account sees the same invite/role/property-
  management UI a large organization does, rather than Habitat hiding that
  complexity for small accounts. See `data-model-notes.md`.
- **Permissions: role-based, with roles scopable to specific properties.**
  The role set is fixed at three — **viewer** (read only), **editor**
  (read/create/update), **admin** (also delete, and manage org
  membership/roles) — enforced backend-side via
  `OrganizationRolePermission`/`ensure_role`
  (`backend/apps/accounts/org_scoping.py`); the frontend only hides
  controls a role can't use. Property scoping
  (`Membership.properties` — leave empty for account-wide, or select
  specific properties to limit a role to just those) is stored and
  editable through the org admin portal, but **not actually enforced
  yet** — every role currently behaves as account-wide regardless of
  which properties are checked (correcting an earlier, inaccurate version
  of this note that claimed it was enforced; `org_scoping.py`'s queryset
  filtering only scopes by organization, never by
  `Membership.properties` — see `docs/manual/roles-and-permissions.md`
  and `limitations.md`, which had this right all along). An org admin
  manages both role and property scope through the in-app org admin portal
  (`/admin`, admin-only) — see `data-model-notes.md`. New members are
  added by an admin either way: **if their email already has a Habitat
  account, they're attached to the org immediately**; **if it's a
  brand-new email, adding them now creates a pending Invitation and
  emails an accept link** (`Invitation` model + `POST /api/org/members/`
  branching on whether the email exists, `GET/POST
  /api/invitations/<token>/(accept/)`, admin-only
  `GET/DELETE /api/org/invitations/` to list/revoke pending ones) rather
  than the admin setting a password directly — see "Auth and API" below
  for the real-email-delivery caveat this still has. A pending invitation
  can also be **resent** (`POST /api/org/invitations/<id>/resend/`,
  admin-only) — refreshes its 7-day expiry and re-sends the same accept
  link, so one that expired unused doesn't have to be revoked and
  recreated from scratch. **That new member can also change their own
  password afterward** via a self-service `/account` page
  (`POST /api/auth/change-password/`, requires the current password,
  keeps the session alive via `update_session_auth_hash`) — and if they
  forget it entirely (so can't supply the *current* password that
  requires), a separate **"forgot password" flow**
  (`POST /api/auth/password-reset/` + `.../confirm/`, both `AllowAny`)
  emails a one-hour, one-time reset link instead. The request endpoint
  always returns the same generic response regardless of whether the
  email has an account, so it can't be used to enumerate registered
  addresses — see "Auth and API" below for why (unlike the invite flow)
  this one has no admin-UI fallback for a case where the email never
  arrives.
- **Auth model: email/password for users, API keys for API access.**
  Human users log in with email/password; third-party API consumers
  authenticate with an API key rather than a user-facing login flow. See
  `roadmap.md` Phase 1 and Phase 4. Still open: whether social login or
  other user-auth options get added later, and API key issuance/rotation
  mechanics (see "Auth and API" below).
- **Photo/media storage: in the database**, not external object storage.
  See `data-model-notes.md` and "Tech / infrastructure" below for the
  operational follow-up this raises (storage growth, backups).
- **Geospatial engine: PostgreSQL + PostGIS**, decided rather than just
  converged-on, with GIS interoperability (GeoJSON/Shapefile/KML/GeoPackage
  export, and eventually import) as an explicit requirement so Habitat data
  can be used in QGIS/ArcGIS and similar tools. See `data-model-notes.md`
  and `tech-stack-options.md`. Still open: import support beyond export.
- **Application framework: Django + GeoDjango, React + MapLibre GL**,
  chosen over the Node/TypeScript and Supabase alternatives, largely on the
  strength of GeoDjango's built-in GIS interoperability and Django REST
  Framework's fit for the Phase 4 public API. See `tech-stack-options.md`.

## Data model

- **Are planned/done-equivalent states reserved?** Since the public view
  depends on the planned-vs-done distinction, does every org-defined
  workflow have to designate which of its custom states map onto
  "planned" and "done," or is that requirement looser than it sounds?
- **Task status states.** Beyond a rough open → assigned → resolved (plus
  dismissed) shape, what's the actual state set, and are they fixed or
  also org-customizable like activity states? (See `data-model-notes.md`.)
- **Notification mechanism when a task is assigned to someone.** (See
  `data-model-notes.md`.)

## Accounts, orgs, and permissions

- **Can a property (and its history) move from one account to another** —
  e.g., a homeowner's property gets formally adopted into a land trust's
  program? What happens to existing records, public page, and prior
  contributors' access? **Explicitly deferred** — judged too open-ended to
  resolve now; revisit if/when it becomes a real, concrete need rather than
  a hypothetical.

## Public input (Phase 5)

- **What form does public input actually take?** Candidates: sighting
  submissions from visitors, requests/suggestions on a property, feedback
  on specific completed work, structured citizen-science observations tied
  to a broader project. Not chosen yet — deliberately deferred (see
  `roadmap.md`).
- **Does public input require moderation before affecting the visible
  record?** Especially relevant for organization-managed public/quasi-public
  land, where unmoderated public submissions could be a liability or
  quality issue. The task mechanism (see "Data model" above and
  `data-model-notes.md`) is a plausible fit for this, but no longer the
  only mechanism sightings flow through now that sighting-activity linking
  doesn't require a task — this needs its own look once Phase 5 is nearer.

## Auth and API

- **Whether to add social login or other user-auth options** beyond the
  decided email/password baseline (see "Recently resolved" above).
- **Real email delivery isn't configured.** The org-invite flow and the
  password-reset flow (both — see "Recently resolved" above) send real
  mail through Django's `send_mail`, but `settings.EMAIL_BACKEND`
  defaults to the console backend (just logs the message) since no SMTP
  provider is chosen yet — tied to the undecided "Hosting/ops model"
  below. Until that's picked, the invite accept link shown/copyable in
  the admin UI is the actual delivery mechanism for invites; the
  password-reset link has no such UI fallback (returning it directly
  would let the endpoint be used to check who has an account — see
  `apps/accounts/password_reset.py`), so that flow is only really
  exercisable today by reading the server's console output.
- **API key issuance and rotation mechanics** — how an account generates,
  scopes, and revokes API keys (see `roadmap.md` Phase 4).
- **API design: REST or GraphQL (or both)?** Not evaluated in depth yet in
  `tech-stack-options.md` — worth a closer look once Phase 4 is nearer.
- **Rate limiting / access tiers for third-party API consumers?** Relevant
  once real downstream programs (use case (e)) start relying on the API.

## Automation / rules engine

- **Rule authoring.** Who can define rules — any contributor, or only
  account admins/managers? Per-property or account-wide? (See
  `data-model-notes.md`.)
- **Rule complexity vs. simplicity.** How much conditional logic is
  exposed to users, given that the Phase 1 baseline has no automation at
  all (task creation and sighting-activity linking are always manual until
  a rules engine exists)? (See `data-model-notes.md`.)
- **Webhook reliability.** Retries, delivery guarantees, payload
  signing/authentication, rate limiting — real integration-surface
  questions once webhooks exist, not just a data-model detail.
- **Auto-linking vs. human review.** Does a rule auto-creating a
  sighting-activity link, or auto-assigning a task, ever happen with zero
  human review, or does it always still produce a notification for someone
  to confirm (even if the action already happened)? A real tradeoff
  between convenience and the risk of a wrong automatic link or
  assignment. (See `use-cases.md` (h).)

## Tech / infrastructure

- **Photo storage growth.** Photos are stored in the database, not
  external object storage (decided — see "Recently resolved" above). That
  keeps ops simple early on, but raises real questions once volume grows:
  database size, backup time/cost, and whether any compression or size
  limit is needed — especially at large-organization scale (many
  properties, many contributors, years of photos). Not addressed yet.
- **GIS import, not just export.** Export to GeoJSON/Shapefile/KML/
  GeoPackage is planned (see "Recently resolved" above); import of
  externally-sourced GIS data (e.g., an organization's existing parcel
  survey, a property boundary from a county GIS office) is a real future
  need but not yet scoped — likely a Phase 3/4-era concern rather than
  Phase 1.
- **Hosting/ops model** — self-hosted vs. managed services, and how that
  choice affects cost as usage scales from one user to many organizations.
  (2026-08-26: a GitHub Actions workflow now builds and publishes the
  backend/frontend Docker images to Docker Hub on push to `main`, a
  version tag, or manual dispatch — see `.github/workflows/
  docker-publish.yml`. That's just an image-publishing step, not a
  hosting decision; the images it builds are still the same dev-oriented
  Dockerfiles `docker-compose.yml` uses locally, so this question stays
  open.)
- **Vanity slug URLs — decided direction, queued for the next build**
  (2026-08-28, owner decision). Public URLs are plain numeric IDs today
  (`/public/org/<id>`, `/public/properties/<id>`). Shape agreed: each
  **organization gets a single vanity slug** (e.g.
  `/public/mira-canyon-trust`), and each of its properties gets a
  **sub-slug underneath it** (e.g.
  `/public/mira-canyon-trust/north-meadow`) — not a separate global
  slug namespace per property. Implementation not started; open
  sub-questions for whoever picks this up: slug uniqueness scope (global
  vs. per-org, though "sub-slug under the org's slug" implies per-org is
  enough for the property half), who sets/edits the slug (admin, on the
  org/property edit forms presumably), what happens to the existing
  numeric-ID URLs (redirect vs. dead), and slugify/collision handling
  (auto-suffix vs. reject-and-ask).
- **QR code generator for public URLs — decided direction, queued for the
  next build** (2026-08-28, owner decision), to ship alongside the vanity
  slugs above (a short, readable URL is exactly what's worth putting on a
  printed sign/QR code). Generate a scannable QR code for a given public
  org or property URL, with an **option to embed an image (e.g. an org's
  logo) in the center of the code**. Implementation not started; open
  sub-questions: generate server-side (a Python QR library, e.g.
  `qrcode` + Pillow for the center-image overlay) vs. client-side in the
  browser; where it's offered in the UI (org admin portal, property page,
  both); output format (PNG/SVG, downloadable); and error-correction
  level (embedding a center image needs a higher error-correction level,
  e.g. `H`, so the code still scans with part of it covered).

## App feedback / build workflow

- **In-app feedback area that feeds the next build's instructions**
  (raised 2026-08-28) — deliberately **not** the Phase 5 "Public input"
  feature above: this is feedback *on the Habitat app itself* from its
  own logged-in users (bug reports, UX friction, feature ideas — product
  feedback about the tool), not visitor-submitted land-management data
  (sightings/observations) on the public site. Different audience,
  different purpose, own category. Decided direction, not built —
  see `build-questions.md`'s queued write-up for the sketch (a
  `Feedback` model, an unreviewed-queue default, an optional AI
  summarization pass) and the flagged trust/auth concern (the owner's
  auto-trust exemption needs to be tied to real authentication, not a
  free-text initials marker anyone could type). **Explicit requirement
  (2026-08-28): this has to be a pipeline, not a manual step** — the
  owner does not want to be the one who opens the database and copies
  feedback into the repo by hand; getting new `Feedback` rows into
  `build-questions.md` has to happen automatically as part of the
  development workflow. See `build-questions.md` for the mechanism
  sketch and the real dependency this raises: it needs *some* live,
  reachable Habitat instance for an automated job to pull from, and
  "Hosting/ops model" (below) is still undecided — this item can't be
  fully built until that is, or at least until a specific dev/staging
  instance exists for the pipeline to target.
