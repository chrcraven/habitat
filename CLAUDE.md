# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code sessions working in this repository. Read this
first, before the docs in `docs/`, to avoid re-deriving context (and
re-spending tokens) that's already settled. Keep this file current: when a
session makes a decision, resolves an open question, or finishes a chunk of
work, update the relevant section below in the same session.

## What Habitat is

A web app for land management: an individual (starting with the author,
doing native plant restoration on their own property) logs activities and
wildlife sightings against a piece of land; the same data can be shown
publicly. One data model and platform scales from a single yard to a land
trust managing many properties and contributors, eventually with a public
API. Full narrative: `README.md` and `docs/vision.md`.

## Source of truth

- `docs/vision.md` — problem, audience, success criteria.
- `docs/use-cases.md` — concrete stories, referenced as `(a)`, `(b)`, etc.
  throughout the other docs.
- `docs/data-model-notes.md` — the data model, in prose. **Read this before
  touching any model/schema code** — it's more current and more detailed
  than any summary here.
- `docs/tech-stack-options.md` — stack evaluation and the decision.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — phased plan (Phase 0 through Phase 5).
- `docs/open-questions.md` — unresolved decisions. **Check here before
  assuming something is decided.** When a session resolves a question, move
  it from here into the relevant doc's "decided" language and delete it (or
  mark it resolved) here, per that file's own header instructions.

Docs are the durable source of truth for product/architecture decisions;
this file is the fast-load index plus session-to-session working notes.
When they conflict, the dated docs above win — fix this file to match.

## Decided (don't re-litigate — full rationale in the docs above)

- **Stack:** Django + GeoDjango + Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL +
  PostGIS, React + MapLibre GL. See `docs/tech-stack-options.md`.
- **Auth:** email/password for human users; API keys for third-party API
  consumers (Phase 4). No social login yet.
- **Account model:** one account = one organization, always multi-user-
  capable (no separate individual/org account types). Every account gets
  the same org-management UI regardless of headcount.
- **Property:** user-drawn boundary, not tied to legal parcel data. One
  account can hold multiple properties.
- **Permissions:** role-based (admin/editor/viewer-ish, exact set still
  open), roles scopable to specific properties.
- **Activity record:** drawn geometry (not a point), org-defined status
  workflow (planned/done are the only fixed points), species/treatment
  resolved against the account's own species list, photos stored in DB,
  notes, public-by-default with a per-record private flag.
- **Sighting record:** point location, same account species list, photos in
  DB, notes, public-by-default with a per-record private flag. Separate
  table from Activity (different geometry type, different lifecycle).
- **Sighting ↔ Activity link:** direct many-to-many, not gated behind a
  task.
- **Task record:** optional, simple user-to-user assignment; can reference a
  sighting or activity or nothing. Not required for the sighting-activity
  link.
- **Species list:** account-defined, not an external taxonomy (GBIF/USDA).
- **Photo/media storage:** in the database, not S3/object storage.
- **Rules engine, API, public input:** deliberately deferred to Phases 4-5 —
  do not build automation, webhooks, or public API surface in Phase 1.

## Current phase: Phase 1 — single-user MVP

Per `docs/roadmap.md`: the author can log their own activities and
sightings; no public view, no multi-tenant UI depth, no API, no rules
engine yet — even though the underlying models are org/multi-user shaped
from day one. Build the real mechanism (org, property, role, task, link),
just don't build the Phase 2+ features that consume it yet.

## Repo layout

- `docs/` — planning docs (see "Source of truth" above).
- `backend/` — Django + GeoDjango project (Phase 1 build, in progress).
- `frontend/` — React + MapLibre GL app (Phase 1 build, in progress).
- `docker-compose.yml` — local dev: Postgres+PostGIS, backend, frontend.
- `CLAUDE.md` — this file.

## Working conventions for this repo

- This is a solo-author, docs-first project. Before writing code that
  touches product behavior, check `docs/open-questions.md` — if the thing
  you're about to build is listed as open, either pick the narrowest
  reasonable default and note the assumption in this file's task log, or
  ask, rather than silently deciding for the project.
- Model changes: update `docs/data-model-notes.md` if the implementation
  reveals something the notes got wrong or didn't anticipate — the doc
  should stay accurate to the real schema, not frozen at its Phase 0 text.
- Don't build ahead of the current phase (see `docs/roadmap.md`). It's
  tempting to wire up the rules engine or public API while touching
  adjacent code — resist; note the idea in open-questions.md instead if
  it's non-obvious.
- Keep `backend/` and `frontend/` runnable via `docker-compose up` — that's
  the expected local dev path given GeoDjango's system-library
  dependencies (GDAL/GEOS/PROJ).

## How to work in this repo (once code exists)

- Backend: `docker-compose up backend db` (or `docker-compose up`), then
  `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py <command>` for
  migrations/shell/tests. See `backend/README.md` for details once it
  exists.
- Frontend: `docker-compose up frontend`, or `cd frontend && npm install &&
  npm run dev` if Node is available locally.
- Tests: backend `python manage.py test` (or pytest if/when adopted);
  frontend test runner TBD.

## Task log

Reverse-chronological. Each entry: what was done, key decisions/assumptions
made along the way, and what's left. Keep entries short — this is a pointer
for the next session, not a full changelog (git history is that).

### 2026-08-07 — Edit/delete, role-based permissions, public-default
### visibility, photo upload

- **Role enforcement (resolves the CRUD half of "Exact role definitions"
  in open-questions.md):** capabilities are now viewer = read only,
  editor = read/create/update, admin = also delete. Enforced backend-side
  in `apps/accounts/org_scoping.py` (`OrganizationRolePermission`, applied
  via `OrganizationScopedViewSet`, plus `ensure_role()` for the
  function-based photo views) — the frontend only *hides* controls the
  user can't use (`frontend/src/auth/roles.ts#roleAtLeast`), it doesn't
  enforce anything on its own.
  - **Assumption:** `Membership.role` now defaults to `viewer` (was
    `admin`) — "minimal permissions until expanded by admin". Signup still
    explicitly grants the account creator `admin` over their own new org
    (unchanged); any *other* membership (today only creatable via Django
    admin — there's still no invite flow, that's Phase 3 per
    `docs/roadmap.md`) starts at viewer. Property-level role scoping
    (`Membership.properties`) is still unenforced — every role here is
    account-wide; add scoping alongside the real invite/role-management UI
    rather than bolting it on now.
  - Migration: `accounts/0002_alter_membership_role.py`.
- **Edit/delete**, all role-gated: Property, Species, Activity, and
  Sighting all now support update/delete via the API (ModelViewSet gave
  this for free) and the frontend (new Edit links + confirm-then-delete
  buttons throughout). `PropertyFormPage`/`ActivityFormPage`/
  `SightingFormPage` were each refactored into an outer
  data-loading component + an inner form that takes an `existing` record —
  handles both the `/new` and `/:id/edit` routes from one file.
  `usePolygonPoints` grew an `initial` param to seed the vertex list from
  an existing geometry.
- **Public-by-default record view:** `GET /activities/` and `/sightings/`
  take `?is_public=true|false`; `PropertyMapPage` defaults to `true`
  (public only) with a "Show private records too" toggle. This is
  visibility *within your own org's app*, not the unauthenticated Phase-2
  public page — is_public still just decides what *that* page will show
  once it exists.
- **Photo upload:** `ActivityPhoto`/`SightingPhoto` now have real
  endpoints — `GET/POST /api/activities/<id>/photos/`,
  `DELETE .../photos/<id>/`, and `GET .../photos/<id>/image/` (raw bytes,
  session-cookie authenticated, used directly as an `<img src>`; same-site
  cookies flow to it because the frontend dev server and backend are both
  `localhost`, just different ports — see the view's docstring if that
  ever needs to be a real cross-site setup). Upload is multipart
  (`MultiPartParser`), capped at 8MB/file with an image-content-type
  check; `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`/`FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` raised
  to 10MB in settings.py (Django's 2.5MB default was too small for a phone
  photo). Frontend: `PhotoUploader` component (thumbnail grid + a
  `capture="environment"` file input), shown only on the *edit* forms
  (photos are nested under a saved record's id, so there's no upload UI on
  the create forms yet — create, then edit to attach photos).
- **Verified for real:** backend — a fresh curl pass proving role
  enforcement (viewer 403s on write, editor 403s on delete, admin
  succeeds), photo upload + byte-for-byte image retrieval, and the
  `is_public` filter. Frontend — Playwright end-to-end: property rename
  persists and re-prefills; activity edit reloads the original drawn
  shape correctly (`usePolygonPoints`'s `initial` seed); photo upload
  shows a thumbnail; delete (property, activity, sighting) removes the
  record and updates the list; the private-by-default toggle actually
  hides/shows the private sighting; and a `viewer`-role account sees zero
  edit/delete controls and zero FABs anywhere in the UI, confirming the
  frontend's role gating matches the backend's actual enforcement.
- **Not done:** invite flow / member management UI (Phase 3, per
  `docs/roadmap.md` — an admin can only create a second Membership via
  Django admin right now); property-level role scoping; photo upload on
  the *create* forms (edit-only for now); Activity↔Species linking is
  still read-only (carried over from last session).

### 2026-08-07 — Phase 1 API + mobile-first frontend (auth → property →
### activity/sighting logging flow works end to end)

- **Backend:** added the first real REST API surface (`/api/...`), session-
  auth only (email/password login, decided — no API keys until Phase 4).
  - `apps/accounts`: `POST /auth/signup` (creates User + Organization +
    admin Membership in one step — this is the actual onboarding path for
    a solo homeowner, not just admin/createsuperuser), `login`, `logout`,
    `me`, `GET /auth/csrf` (sets the cookie the SPA needs before its first
    POST — see the module docstring in `apps/accounts/views.py`), plus
    `PropertyViewSet`.
  - `apps/species`, `apps/activities` (`ActivityViewSet`,
    read-only `WorkflowStateViewSet`), `apps/sightings` (`SightingViewSet`)
    — each scoped to the caller's organization via a shared
    `OrganizationScopedViewSet` base (`apps/accounts/org_scoping.py`).
  - **Assumption, not yet in open-questions.md:** a user's *first*
    Membership is treated as their one active organization context —
    there's no org switcher. Fine for Phase 1 (one org per user in
    practice); revisit if/when a user belongs to more than one org.
  - Geometry fields serialize as GeoJSON via `djangorestframework-gis`
    (`GeoFeatureModelSerializer`) — added to `requirements.txt`. Frontend
    sends/receives plain GeoJSON geometries directly.
  - **Scoped out for this session:** Activity's species (M2M through
    `ActivitySpecies`, which has its own role/quantity/detail fields) isn't
    writable via the API yet — `.set()` doesn't work against a custom
    `through` model, and building the nested-write endpoint felt like its
    own chunk of work. `ActivitySerializer.species_names` is read-only for
    now. Sighting's species (a plain FK) *is* fully wired up. Next session
    should add real Activity↔Species write support (probably a small
    nested serializer + explicit create/update handling in the view) if
    that's needed before Phase 2.
  - **Verified for real, not just "looks right":** installed GDAL/GEOS/PROJ
    + a local PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS 3 in the sandbox (no Docker daemon
    available here), ran `migrate` against live PostGIS, and drove the
    entire API by hand with `curl`: signup → CSRF → create property with a
    drawn boundary → list properties → workflow states → create species →
    create activity (polygon) → create sighting (point) → me → logout (then
    confirmed `me` correctly 403s). All passed. `manage.py check` and
    `makemigrations --check` are also clean.
- **Frontend:** rebuilt as a real mobile-first app (react-router-dom added;
  this was previously just a bare map shell).
  - Structure: `api/` (typed fetch client + CSRF handling), `auth/`
    (session context + route guard), `components/` (`MapCanvas` — the
    MapLibre wrapper, `AppShell`/`TopBar`/`BottomNav`), `hooks/`
    (`useAsync`, `usePolygonPoints`), `pages/` (Login, Signup, Properties
    list, Property new/map, Activity new, Sighting new, Species), `utils/
    geo.ts` (bbox math, geolocation wrapper).
  - **No drawing library** (mapbox-gl-draw/terra-draw etc.) — polygons are
    drawn by tapping the map to add vertices (`usePolygonPoints` +
    `MapCanvas`'s `onClick`), with Undo/Clear buttons. Simple, no extra
    dependency, and touch-friendly by construction. Revisit only if this
    proves too limited (e.g. editing an existing shape's vertices).
  - **Map zooms to fit the property** (the specific ask this session):
    `MapCanvas` takes a `bounds` prop and calls `fitBounds` when it
    changes; `utils/geo.ts#polygonBounds` computes it from the property's
    GeoJSON boundary with no turf dependency. Used on the property map page
    and pre-applied on the activity/sighting draw pages so drawing starts
    already zoomed to the right property.
  - Nav is a bottom tab bar on narrow viewports, repositioned to a left
    sidebar at `min-width: 768px` (see `.app-nav` in `index.css`). Only two
    top-level areas (Properties, Species) — activity/sighting logging lives
    inside a property's own map page (FAB buttons) rather than getting its
    own nav entry, matching Phase 1's scope.
  - **Verified for real:** `npm run build` (tsc + vite) is clean, and the
    entire flow — signup → draw+save a property → map zooms to it → draw
    an activity → capture a sighting (tap-to-place, no location permission
    needed) → both show up correctly positioned on the map and in the
    lists below it — was driven end to end with Playwright at an iPhone-12
    viewport against the live backend above, with screenshots at each
    step. Also checked the same flow renders correctly in the desktop
    sidebar layout at 1280px.
  - Two real bugs the browser run caught (fixed, not just noted): (1)
    MapLibre's default attribution control anchors bottom-right, the same
    corner as the FAB buttons — it was silently eating taps on
    "+ Activity"/"+ Sighting" once expanded; moved it to bottom-left
    (`MapCanvas.tsx`). (2) The activity form's `date_planned`/`date_done`
    side-by-side field row pushed the second date input off-screen on a
    390px-wide phone; `.field-row` now stacks below `480px`.
  - **Not done yet:** editing/deleting properties, activities, or
    sightings (create + list only); Activity's species picker (see backend
    note above); photo upload (both models support it server-side —
    `ActivityPhoto`/`SightingPhoto` — but there's no upload endpoint or UI
    yet); no frontend test runner configured; no `.env`/`VITE_API_URL`
    documented for a non-localhost deploy. Bundle-size warning from
    `maplibre-gl` on `npm run build` (~1MB unminified-gzip) — fine for now,
    code-splitting the map page would be the fix if it matters later.

### 2026-08-07 — Initial backend + frontend scaffolding, CLAUDE.md

- Added this file.
- Scaffolded `backend/`: Django project (`config/`) + apps `accounts`
  (custom email-based User, Organization, Property, Membership),
  `species` (account-defined Species list), `activities` (Activity,
  ActivityPhoto, ActivitySpecies through model, WorkflowState),
  `sightings` (Sighting, SightingPhoto, SightingActivityLink),
  `tasks` (Task). Models follow `docs/data-model-notes.md` directly;
  see model docstrings for field-level notes/open questions.
- GIS fields use GeoDjango (`PolygonField` for activity geometry,
  `PointField` for sighting location), SRID 4326.
- Photos stored in DB as `BinaryField` + content-type, per the decided
  storage approach — no external object storage or filesystem `MEDIA_ROOT`
  use for these.
- `WorkflowState` is per-Organization with `is_planned`/`is_done` boolean
  flags rather than a fixed enum, per the org-defined-workflow decision.
  **Assumption (not yet in open-questions.md as resolved):** a brand-new
  Organization gets seeded with a default 3-state workflow
  (Planned → In Progress → Done) via a `post_save` signal / data migration,
  so a solo user isn't forced to configure a workflow before logging their
  first activity. This answers one bullet under "Data model" in
  `docs/open-questions.md` — revisit if that default set turns out wrong.
- Scaffolded `frontend/`: Vite + React + TypeScript + MapLibre GL, with a
  minimal map view as the starting shell. No API integration yet — backend
  has no REST endpoints exposed yet either (DRF is installed but no
  serializers/viewsets/urls beyond Django admin).
- Added `docker-compose.yml` (postgis/postgis image + backend + frontend)
  and `backend/Dockerfile` so GDAL/GEOS/PROJ system deps don't have to be
  installed on the host.
- Verified the backend actually works, not just "looks right": installed
  Django + GDAL/GEOS system libs in the sandbox, ran `manage.py check`
  (clean) and `manage.py makemigrations` for real — it generated correct
  migrations for all 5 apps with no errors. Migration files are committed.
  Frontend: `npm install && npm run build` (tsc + vite) succeeds cleanly.
  Neither was run against a *live* Postgres/PostGIS instance (none
  available in this sandbox) — that's still untested.
- **Not done yet:** `migrate` against a live DB (do this first next
  session — `docker-compose up` then
  `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate`); DRF
  serializers/viewsets/API urls; auth wiring (djoser or hand-rolled);
  frontend-backend integration; tests; admin site polish beyond basic
  registration; frontend has no linting configured yet. Next session should
  confirm `docker-compose up` + `migrate` works end to end, then build the
  activity-logging flow (create property → draw activity geometry → save)
  since that's the core of the Phase 1 MVP.
